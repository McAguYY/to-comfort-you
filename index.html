<p>Yoo, kabantay ko na disappointed kas grades nimo nya ga hilak man ka gahapon so mao diay tohh bisag di nimo e-ingon I know na you're feeling down,😞😞😞 the purpose ra ani na letter is to make you feel better nya this is my way of comforting people, don't feel down kay ni gamay imo grades ma-bawi rana nimo, always remember na its ok to lose sometimes kay ana raman gyud ang life, and also gika-daghan na ni ug ingon na grades doesn't define who you are and that is true, also here's a quote to at least ma relieved ka "If you keep your eyes and ears open, life will show you everything you need to know." 😇😇😇 alright that's all, I hope na this will make you feel better.😉🙌</p>
